# Lens MVP

North star: make real R-lens, J-lens, and template-lens readouts plus ordered
post-block interventions usable from a simple local CLI soon enough to preserve
experiment time.

Deadline: first usable command today. Missed timeboxes trigger consultation,
not compensating abstraction.

## Done When

- [x] Native R-lens and J-lens fitting/readout commands exist.
- [x] Published full-J import and readout commands exist.
- [x] A real template-lens readout matches its source semantics.
- [x] Fixed and residual-L2-relative additions work.
- [x] Projection ablation and source-to-target displacement work.
- [x] Layer, prefill-position, and decode-step scopes work.
- [x] Matching operations execute in file order.
- [x] The minimal CLI runs with real lens directions.
- [x] Packed full-J traces cover layer x position top-k and occurrence counts.
- [x] Explicit layer:position masks can export transported J-space vectors.
- [x] Flash-Next exposes serial native hyper-state capture and fixed addition.
- [x] The CLI runs Flash-Next with explicit native hyper directions.
- [x] Muse Glimmer fits and runs composed full/sliding selected-token J/R lenses.
- [x] Muse Glimmer applies scoped, ordered selected-token interventions.

## Model Support

| Runtime | Readout/Fit | Intervention | Packed | Next Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary dense | native J/R + full-J trace | live CLI passed | vectors + top-k | complete |
| ordinary MoE | selected rows; fitting deferred | live CLI passed | runtime exists | lens fitting |
| Flash-Next/qwen4exp | native hyper capture; lenses deferred | CLI fixed add passed | serial only | rectangular readout |
| Muse Glimmer 30B | composed multi-source J/R selected tokens | live CLI passed | scalar live readout | REST after CLI use |

## Current Status

The CLI handoff is verified on real dense, ordinary MoE, native J/R, and
workspace-template assets. Selected-mask vector export is complete for dense
published full-J traces. Muse Glimmer scalar text generation matches the local
Q8 llama.cpp logits oracle. Real Q8 `fit-tokens` and `run` commands now produce
and consume model-bound J/R artifacts across composed full/sliding blocks, with
multiple selected source layers and prefill/decode readouts at the post-block
residual coordinate. The same Muse runner now supports fixed, residual-relative,
projection-ablation, and source-to-target actions with ordered stacking and
exact layer/prefill/decode scopes.
Flash-Next remains available as a raw hyper-state path, but lens work is frozen
until a genuine rectangular fitting or asset path exists.

## Next Gate

Hold the verified CLI contract stable for immediate use. The next interface
slice is a thin local REST adapter over the same plan, input, and output
semantics; it must add no authentication, execution modes, batching, caching,
or UI, and must not block CLI use.

## Hard Exclusions

Artifact security/publication, scientific workflows or analysis, UI, generic
plugins, unrelated test repair, cross-device support, and production hardening.

## Blockers

- None.

## Fast Follows

1. Rectangular Flash-Next transport/readout when a genuine fit or asset exists.
2. Sparse position filtering and traces beyond 128 positions.
3. Corpus batching only after measured throughput requires it.
4. Decide whether large operation schedules need an application-output cap.

This file is updated in place. It is not a work log or design document. Keep
one active gate, at most three blockers, and at most five fast follows.
