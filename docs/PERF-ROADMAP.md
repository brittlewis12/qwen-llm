# Performance Roadmap

Current-state and evidence index. This page records what has shipped and which
questions the evidence has closed. Dated measurements remain in
[PERF-LOG](PERF-LOG.md) and the linked benchmark packets.

## Shipped state

- Family serving, request timing, and benchmark contracts are documented in
  [SERVE](SERVE.md), [REQUEST-TIMING](REQUEST-TIMING.md), and [BENCH](BENCH.md).
- Current profiling coverage includes the Metal trace parser and
  `qwen-bench metal-counters`; see [PERF-TOOLS](PERF-TOOLS.md).
- Automatic dense refill, ragged selection, and file-root reuse have dated
  evidence in [automatic dense ragged refill](bench/2026-08-12-automatic-dense-refill/README.md),
  [automatic dense ragged selection](bench/2026-08-12-qwen-ragged-fixed-cohorts/README.md),
  and [fixed-cohort file roots](bench/2026-08-12-qwen-fixed-file-root/README.md).
- DeepSeek V4.1 current requirements and operation live in
  [DEEPSEEK-V41-STRATEGY](DEEPSEEK-V41-STRATEGY.md) and
  [DEEPSEEK-V41-BRINGUP](DEEPSEEK-V41-BRINGUP.md).

## Closed questions

- The owned-arena loader did not pass loaded-decode and whole-request gates;
  the descriptor-derived population plan is the shipped path. See the
  [2026-10-19 entry](PERF-LOG.md#2026-10-19-descriptor-derived-gguf-population-plan-owned-arena-archived).
- The GLM Q4 pilot showed no quality advantage over the incumbent IQ3 artifact
  in its registered cases. See the
  [2026-10-17 entry](PERF-LOG.md#2026-10-17---three-way-glm-pilot-finds-no-q4-quality-advantage).
- ReplaySSM precision separation did not justify changing production FP32
  recurrence. See the
  [2026-10-13 entry](PERF-LOG.md#2026-10-13---replayssm-precision-separation-works-keep-production-fp32).
- Whole-model DeepSeek residency remains closed because forced termination left
  system-wide wired memory. See the
  [2026-08-13 entry](PERF-LOG.md#2026-08-13-whole-model-residency-optimization-lane-closed).

## Historical planning maps

The dated leverage maps, ranked queues, and their evidence pointers are retained
verbatim in [PERF-ROADMAP-2026-10-19](archive/PERF-ROADMAP-2026-10-19.md).
